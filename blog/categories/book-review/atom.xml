    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.packtpub.com/drools-jboss-rules-5-0-developers-guide/book">The Developer&rsquo;s Guide</a> is the second book about
Drools available from <a href="http://www.packtpub.com">Packt</a>. It nicely extends the Drools documentation showing a new point
of view at almost all features.</p>

<p>Although it wasn&rsquo;t always easy to follow I definitely recommend this book to developers who either are starting their
journey with this rule engine or are already familiar with Drools. Examples are not trivial &lsquo;hello world&rsquo; applications.
Especially my favorite Drools Fusion chapter about complex event processing is built up on quite advanced rules for a
fraud detection system.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>One chapter is dedicated to performance, which is a must-read for all who have to deal with a huge amount of rules
and facts. It explains how to write rules to take advantage of node sharing and how to speed up fact propagation
using parallel mode.</p>

<p>Another chapter is dedicated to a complete 3-tier JEE application. It&rsquo;s built up on Hibernate (for persistence),
Bitronix transaction manager (for transactions), Spring MVC (for presentation) and obviously Drools (for business logic).</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s also worth to note is the test driven development style presented in almost all examples.</p>

<p>To sum it up, building rule based services is not an easy task. This book introduces the Drools rule engine and deals
with almost all its capabilities - starting with the core engine functionality, going through decision tables,
complex event processing and business process presentation ending with advanced topics covering performance and
integration points with other systems.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s quite difficult to get started with Drools, especially if you don&rsquo;t have experience in developing Java
applications. You might imagine how steep the learning curve is for business analysts, who associates Java with an
island or coffee. However <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/jboss-drools-business-rules/book">this book</a> is aimed at exactly
this group of non-technical people, who have knowledge how business runs, but don&rsquo;t know how or simply don&rsquo;t have the
tools to persist it and &lsquo;transfer it to the world of computers&rsquo;.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Most chapters are kept on a really basic level if it comes to writing Java code. On the other hand it&rsquo;s sufficient to
get started. Moreover all used tools are open source software, which means you can use it for free.</p>

<p>This book goes through almost all parts of Drools, especially the most important for business people like Guvnor,
the application for authoring rules, DSLs allowing to write rules in plain English as well as support for the business
analyst&rsquo;s most favorite tool: Excel spreadsheets.</p>

<p>The author even introduces typical developers&#8217; tools like Eclipse, however I would recommend to go through an updated
guide about installing the Eclipse plugin available in the
<a href="http://downloads.jboss.com/drools/docs/5.0.1.26597.FINAL/drools-introduction/html_single/index.html#d0e1371">Drools docs</a>.
A new requirement, that did not make it into this book, is to set up the Drools rule engine.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a chapter I like very much. It makes very clear that testing rules is an important part of the development cycle
and introduces three different ways to achieve full coverage of all written rules. The inquisitive reader might also
have a look at the QA Analyzer, a quite new and powerful feature available in Guvnor.</p>

<p>One chapter is definitely intended for Java developers - about deploying Drools applications in real world scenarios.
The business people will still be able to follow, since the author keeps things easy and doesn&rsquo;t go to deep into
details, however I would love to read more about this topic.</p>

<p>The last two chapters about rule engine concepts and the newest features are a must-read for all those people who have
read the Drools docs, but still need a different point of view to fully understand how Drools works. This topic is very
important in my opinion, since it lets you write your rules more effectively.</p>

<p>What I didn&rsquo;t like was the use of IE and Excel. Same results could be achieved with open source software, too. But
that&rsquo;s a minor one ;)</p>

<p>All in all, definitely a guide for non technical users, but also for developers, who have given the Drools docs a
(second and third) try and still require a helping hand to sort it out how this Drools thing works and how to use it
properly.</p>
